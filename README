Annotation pipeline

This is a set of scripts used to refine and extend existing mRNA 3' end annotations using Quant seq 3' end sequencing (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.f.376) and RNAseq. 

Installation

Clone from github
git clone https://github.com/poojabhat1690/refine-pipeline.git
cd pipeline/pre-processing/

The following dependencies that have to be installed. 
cutadapt
bedtools
python

Quickstart

The script required to run the whole pipeline is beforeMapping.new.sh

beforeMapping.new.sh [-a adapter] [-i input directory] [-o output directory] [-g genome file] [-t threshold for priming sites]
[-u ucscDir] [-e ensemblDir] [-m mode rnadeq p/s/S] [-c condition]
                -a 3' adapter sequences that has to be removed using cutadapt
                -i input directory containing two folders named - quantseq, rnaseq
                   quantseq: contains *.fastq, *.fq.gz, *fq  files. 
                   rnaseq: mapped, sorted and indexed bam files. 
                -o Output directory
                -t threshold of the number of reads to define a priming site.
                -u ucsc directory containing annotations downloaded from ucsc table browser. 
                -e ensembl directory containing ensembl annotations ontained from biomart. 
                -m mode of counting for RNAseq coverage, derived from bedtools multicov (s: counting on the same strand, 
                        p: paired end reads, S: counting on the opposite strand)
                -c condition of sample (example: timepoint or organism)
